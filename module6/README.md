  ## For Deployment
  The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

  If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

  Path: `~/`

  ## Contents

  The following is the entire contents of the directory. This directory is housed at the `MUDSA/StatMath` repository.

  file/directory | description
