# Video 3: Reading `lm()` and `summary()` output

**Classification**: Concept / Example problem shown

**Subject**: Linear regression, t-values, p-values

**Topics**:

* loading data into R
* residuals
* quantiles
* standard error
* t-values
* p-values
* residual standard error
* degrees of freedom
* multiple R squared values
* adjusted R-squared
* F-Statistic

**Level**: advanced

**Prerequisite skills or knowledge**: 

Students need to know what the following terms are and how they are used:
* t-values
* p-values
* hypothesis testing
* linear regression residuals
* F-statistc

**Time Requirements for Viewing**: 12 minutes

**Incentive Activity**:

* Take the three random ordered pairs
* Plot them in R
* Use `lm()` to find the coefficients for the linear regression line
* Use `summary()` to print out a table of information about the data
* Questions:
  * What is the equation for the linear regression line?
  * What do the t-values and p-values tell us about the coefficients?
  * What does the r^2 value tell us? 

**Next video topics**: Non-linear regression
