This second module aims at teaching you the difference between univariate and multivariate data. How to analyze multi dimensional data using vectors. Data analysis using visualizations and descriptive statistics on vectors.


## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.
