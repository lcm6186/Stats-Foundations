  ## For Deployment
  The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

  If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

  Path: `~/`

  file/directory | Deployed By:

  ## Contents

  The following is the entire contents of the directory. This directory is housed at the `MUDSA/StatMath` repository.

  `module7.md`   | outline of module activities and resources
  `labs/`        | introductory notebooks to new concept materials
  `practices/`   | less scaffolded version of lab notebooks
  `exercises/`   | code exercises covering topics discussed in the module
  `answers/`     | answers for practice and exercise notebooks
  `images/`      | a directory of images that are used in the notebooks
