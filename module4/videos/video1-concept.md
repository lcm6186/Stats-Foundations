**Incentive Activity**: Given a population and a sample, have them calculate
the standard error and confidence interval. For example:

Suppose the population you are looking at is all the high school students in
the United States and we are interested to know what the average grade point
average of these students is. Say we take a sample of 100 students and look at
their grade point average. The gpa of this sample is 3.2 and the standard
deviation is 0.2. Suppose we take another sample whose mean is 3.0 and the
standard deviation is 0.34. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for each of
these two samples.

real data
