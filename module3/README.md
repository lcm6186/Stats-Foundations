# Module 3: Multivariate data exploration

This module aims at making you realize the limitations of plotting visualizations of multivariate data. It exploits commands like apply() and table() to analyze multi dimensional data using vectors. Feature selection, dimensionality reduction using Principal component analysis are discussed.


## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

Path: `DSA-8610/`

Path: `modules/module3/`
