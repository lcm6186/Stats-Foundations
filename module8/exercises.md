## Concept Problems

### Distribution free tables

#### Topics

* Distribution free tables (ch 18 of ItS book)
  * Intro (benefits)
  * Randomization tests: two conditions
  * Randomization tests: two or more conditions
  * Randomization tests: Associations (Pearson's r)
  * Randomization tests: Contigency tables (Fisher's exact test)
  * Randomization tests: Two or more conditions (Kruskal-Wallis)

#### Exercises

* For the following data, how many ways could the data be arranged
  (including the original arrangement) so that the advantage of the
  Experimental Group mean over the Control Group mean is as large or
  larger then the original arrangement.

  | Experimental | Control |
  |--------------|---------|
  | 5            | 1       |
  | 10           | 2       |
  | 15           | 3       |
  | 16           | 4       |
  | 17           | 9       |

* For the data in Problem 1, how many ways can the data be rearranged?

* What is the one-tailed probability for a test of the difference.

* For the following data, how many ways can the data be rearranged?

  | T1 | T2 | Control |
  |----|----|---------|
  | 7  | 14 | 0       |
  | 8  | 19 | 2       |
  | 11 | 21 | 5       |

* In general, are rank randomization tests or randomization tests more
  powerful?

* What is the advantage of rank randomization tests over randomization
  tests?

* Test whether the differences among conditions for the data in Problem
  1 is significant (one tailed) at the .01 level using a rank
  randomizaton test.

### Effect size

#### Topics

* Effect size (ch 19 of ItS book)
  * Proportions
  * Difference between two means
  * Proportion of variance explained

#### Exercises

* If the probability of a disease is .34 without treatment and .22 with
  treatment then what is the
  * absolute risk reduction
  * relative risk reduction
  * Odds ratio
  * Number needed to treat

* When is it meaningful to compute the proportional difference between
  means?

* The mean for an experimental group is 12, the mean for the control
  group were 8, the MSE from the ANOVA is 16, and N, the number of
  observations is 20, compute g and d.

* Two experiments investigated the same variables but one of the
  experiment had subject who differed greatly from each other whereas
  the subjects in the other experiment were relatively
  homogeneous. Which experiment would likely have the larger value of g?

* Why is \omega^2 preferable to \eta^2?

* What is the difference between \eta^2 and partial \eta^2?
