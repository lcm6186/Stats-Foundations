#### Exercises

* An experiment is conducted to test the claim that James Bond can taste
  the difference between a Martini that is shaken and one that is
  stirred. What is the null hypothesis?

* The following explanation is incorrect. What three words should be
  added to make it correct? The probability value is the probability of
  obtaining a statistic as different (add three words here) from the
  parameter specified in the null hypothesis as the statistic obtained
  in the experiment. The probability value is computed assuming that the
  null hypothesis is true.

* Why do experimenters test hypotheses they think are false?

* State the null hypothesis for:
  * An experiment testing whether echinacea decreases the length of
    colds.
  * A correlational study on the relationship between brain size and
    intelligence.
  * An investigation of whether a self-proclaimed psychic can predict
    the outcome of a coin flip.
  * A study comparing a drug with a placebo on the amount of pain
    relief. (A one-tailed test was used.)

* (_need a graph_) Assume the null hypothesis is that μ = 50 and that
  the graph shown below is the sampling distribution of the mean
  (M). Would a sample value of M= 60 be significant in a two-tailed test
  at the .05 level?  Roughly what value of M would be needed to be
  significant?

* A researcher develops a new theory that predicts that vegetarians will
  have more of a particular vitamin in their blood than
  non-vegetarians. An experiment is conducted and vegetarians do have
  more of the vitamin, but the difference is not significant. The
  probability value is 0.13. Should the experimenter’s confidence in the
  theory increase, decrease, or stay the same?

* A significance test is performed and p = .20. Why can’t the
  experimenter claim that the probability that the null hypothesis is
  true is .20?

* For a drug to be approved by the FDA, the drug must be shown to be
  safe and effective. If the drug is significantly more effective than a
  placebo, then the drug is deemed effective. What do you know about the
  effectiveness of a drug once it has been approved by the FDA (assuming
  that there has not been a Type I error)?

* When is it valid to use a one-tailed test? What is the advantage of a
  one-tailed test? Give an example of a null hypothesis that would be
  tested by a one-tailed test.

* Distinguish between probability value and significance level.

* Suppose a study was conducted on the effectiveness of a class on “How
  to take tests.” The SAT scores of an experimental group and a control
  group were compared. (There were 100 subjects in each group.) The mean
  score of the experimental group was 503 and the mean score of the
  control group was 499. The difference between means was found to be
  significant, p = .037. What do you conclude about the effectiveness of
  the class?

* Is it more conservative to use an alpha level of .01 or an alpha level
  of .05? Would beta be higher for an alpha of .05 or for an alpha of
  .01?

* Why is “Ho: “M1 = M2” not a proper null hypothesis?

* An experimenter expects an effect to come out in a certain
  direction. Is this sufficient basis for using a one-tailed test? Why
  or why not?

* How do the Type I and Type II error rates of one-tailed and two-tailed
  tests differ?

* A two-tailed probability is .03. What is the one-tailed probability if
  the effect were in the specified direction? What would it be if the
  effect were in the other direction?

* You choose an alpha level of .01 and then analyze your data.
  * What is the probability that you will make a Type I error given that
    the null hypothesis is true?
  * What is the probability that you will make a Type I error given that
    the null hypothesis is false?

* Why doesn’t it make sense to test the hypothesis that the sample mean
  is 42?

* True/false: It is easier to reject the null hypothesis if the
  researcher uses a smaller alpha (α) level.

* True/false: You are more likely to make a Type I error when using a

* True/false: You accept the alternative hypothesis when you reject the
  null hypothesis. small sample than when using a large sample.

* True/false: You do not accept the null hypothesis when you fail to
  reject it.

* True/false: A researcher risks making a Type I error any time the null
  hypothesis is rejected.

### Testing means

#### Topics

* Testing means (ch 12 of ItS book)
  * testing a single mean
  * Difference between two means (independent groups)
  * All pairwise comparisons among means
  * Specific comparisons
  * Pairwise comparisons

#### Exercises

* The scores of a random sample of 8 students on a physics test are as
  follows: 60, 62, 67, 69, 70, 72, 75, and 78.
  * Test to see if the sample mean is significantly different from 65 at
    the .05 level. Report the t and p values.
  * The researcher realizes that she accidentally recorded the score
    that should have been 76 as 67. Are these corrected scores
    significantly different from 65 at the .05 level?

* A (hypothetical) experiment is conducted on the effect of alcohol on
  perceptual motor ability. Ten subjects are each tested twice, once
  after having two drinks and once after having two glasses of
  water. The two tests were on two different days to give the alcohol a
  chance to wear off. Half of the subjects were given alcohol first and
  half were given water first. The scores of the 10 subjects are shown
  below. The first number for each subject is their per- formance in the
  “water” condition. Higher scores reflect better performance. Test to
  see if alcohol had a significant effect. Report the t and p values.

  | water | alcohol |
  | ----- | ------- |
  |   16  |    13   |
  |   15  |    13   |
  |   11  |    10   |
  |   20  |    18   |
  |   19  |    17   |
  |   14  |    11   |
  |   13  |    10   |
  |   15  |    15   |
  |   14  |    11   |
  |   16  |    16   |

* The sampling distribution of a statistic is normally distributed with
  an estimated standard error of 12 (df = 20). (a) What is the
  probability that you would have gotten a mean of 107 (or more extreme)
  if the population parameter were 100? Is this probability significant
  at the .05 level (two-tailed)? (b) What is the probability that you
  would have gotten a mean of 95 or less (one-tailed)? Is this
  probability significant at the .05 level? You may want to use the t
  Distribution calculator for this problem.

* How do you decide whether to use an independent groups t test or a
  correlated t test (test of dependent means)?

* An experiment compared the ability of three groups of subjects to
  remember briefly-presented chess positions. The data are shown below.

  | Non-players | Beginners | Tournament players |
  | ----------- | --------- | ------------------ |
  |     22.1    |    32.5   |         40.1       |
  |     22.3    |    37.1   |         45.6       |
  |     26.2    |    39.1   |         51.2       |
  |     29.6    |    40.5   |         56.4       |
  |     31.7    |    45.5   |         58.1       |
  |     33.5    |    51.3   |         71.1       |
  |     38.9    |    52.6   |         74.9       |
  |     39.7    |    55.7   |         75.9       |
  |     43.2    |    55.9   |         80.3       |
  |     43.2    |    57.7   |         85.3       |

  * Using the Tukey HSD procedure, determine which groups are
    significantly different from each other at the .05 level.
  * Now compare each pair of groups using t-tests. Make sure to control
    for the familywise error rate (at 0.05) by using the Bonferroni
    correction. Specify the alpha level you used.

* Assume the data in the previous problem were collected using two
  different groups of subjects: One group used their preferred hand and
  the other group used their non-preferred hand. Analyze the data and
  compare the results to those for the previous problem.

* You have 4 means, and you want to compare each mean to every other
  mean. (a) How many tests total are you going to compute? (b) What
  would be the chance of making at least one Type I error if the Type I
  error for each test was .05 and the tests were independent? (c) Are
  the tests independent and how does independence/non-independence
  affect the probability in (b).

* If you have 5 groups in your study, why shouldn’t you just compute a t
  test of each group mean with each other group mean?

* You are conducting a study to see if students do better when they
  study all at once or in intervals. One group of 12 participants took a
  test after studying for one hour continuously. The other group of 12
  participants took a test after studying for three twenty minute
  sessions. The first group had a mean score of 75 and a variance
  of 120. The second group had a mean score of 86 and a variance of 100.
  * What is the calculated t value? Are the mean test scores of these
    two groups significantly different at the .05 level?
  * What would the t value be if there were only 6 participants in each
    group? Would the scores be significant at the .05 level?

* A new test was designed to have a mean of 80 and a standard deviation
  of 10. A random sample of 20 students at your school take the test,
  and the mean score turns out to be 85. Does this score differ
  significantly from 80?

* True/false: When you are conducting a one-sample t test and you know
  the population standard deviation, you look up the critical t value in
  the table based on the degrees of freedom.
